# wordpress-practice

This is a Wordpress theme created for a fake IT company, i think its best that i make a site about something i know while i learn Wordpress theme development.

The theme consists of three Custom Post Types for easier adding and or removing content from the site. You can find the file that contains the Custom Post Types information in the mu-plugins folder.

At the moment the index.php only has static content that can not be edited via the Wordpress control panel.

Please be aware that i am still learning Wordpress development so some things may not work and or look as expected.
